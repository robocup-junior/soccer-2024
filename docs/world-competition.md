# RoboCupJunior SoccerSim World Championship 2024

RoboCupJunior World Championship 2024 will be held in July in Eindhoven,
Netherlands. After last year’s success, we would like to continue with the
organization of the SoccerSim challenge this year as well.
The competition will be held virtually, but again in an "offline" mode,
since most of the committee members will be located at the physical RCJ in Eindhoven.

## Competition overview

SoccerSim challenge this year includes:

* Simulation of matches
* Presentation of team description papers
* Solving Technical Challenges (To be decided)

As usual, teams will be asked to submit the code of their robot players.
We have frozen the `rcj-soccersim` software which is [available as a tagged release
at our GitHub](https://github.com/robocup-junior/rcj-soccersim/releases/tag/v2.2). This release will be used for simulating the matches.

In order to spread the knowledge, we ask teams to provide team
description papers. These might contain descriptions of team members’ roles,
various approaches you have tried while implementing the code for
simulated robots as well as anything you consider worth mentioning.
For inspiration, feel free to
[check previous year's papers out](https://github.com/robocup-junior/awesome-rcj-soccer#soccersim-online-event)!

If the committee has enough time while preparing for international event,
there will be at most two technical challenges.
`rcj-soccersim` software will be updated appropriately for these challenges.
There will be several days reserved for you to implement your solution
and submit a recorded video. The committee will then review it and evaluate each team on a rubric.

## Rules

The rules are based on the regular RoboCupJunior Soccer rules, adapted to the
simulation environment.

You can find them at
[GitHub](https://github.com/robocup-junior/soccer-rules-simulation/blob/master/rules.pdf)

## Documentation

We now have two full fledged documentation articles that can help you get
started programming your robots:

- [How to program your robot](https://robocup-junior.github.io/rcj-soccersim/how_to_robot/)
- [Inter-robot communication](https://robocup-junior.github.io/rcj-soccersim/communication_between_robots/)

If you feel like there is something missing in the documentation, do not
hesitate to suggest a change -- Pull Requests are very much welcome!
